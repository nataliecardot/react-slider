# react-slider

Very simple app featuring data with previous and next buttons that navigate between list items. Also includes autoslide functionality (goes to next item in list after a certain amount of time). Slide-in/slide-out animation upon clicking prev/next buttons achieved using transitions and transformations.

To view, run `npm i && npm start` in downloaded project.
